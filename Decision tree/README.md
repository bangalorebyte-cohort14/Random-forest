# Decision-Tree
Regressor and Classifier 

Fit a decision tree using any dataset (discrete or continous) used previously. You need to tune the hyperparameters as to minimize the RMSE or Accuracy and use graphviz (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/graphviz)  to print your final, tuned tree. 

To go over any theory, look at the Decisoin Tree section of ISLR.
